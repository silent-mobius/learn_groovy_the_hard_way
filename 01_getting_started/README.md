# Groovy

## Getting Started

### Intro

Groovy is a flexible open source language built for the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) with a Java-like syntax. It can be used dynamically (where any variable can hold any type of object) or statically typed (where the type of each variable is heavily restricted); itâ€™s your choice. In most other languages, it is one or the other. It supports functional programming constructs, including first-class functions, currying, and more. It has multiple inheritance, type inference, and meta-programming.

Groovy began in 2003 partly as a response to Ruby. Its main features were dynamic typing, meta-programming (the ability to change classes at runtime), and tight integration with Java. Although its original creator left it around 2005, many developers in the community have contributed to it over the years. Various organizations have supported the development of Groovy in the past, and like many open source projects, it cannot be attributed to one person or company. It has been an Apache Software Foundation2 project since 2015.

Groovy is very similar in syntax to Java, so it is generally easy for Java developers to learn (Java code is generally valid Groovy code, especially since Groovy 3.0, which added support for Java-like array declarations and many other Java syntax features). However,Groovy has many additional features and relaxed syntax rules: closures, dynamic typing, meta-programming (via metaClass), optional semicolons, regex support, operator overloading, GStrings, and more. Groovy is interpreted at runtime, but in Groovy 2.0, the ability to compile to byte-code and enforce type-checking were added to the language.
